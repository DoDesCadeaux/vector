# Vector Library for Python

Welcome to the Vector Library for Python! This lightweight library is designed to facilitate basic vector manipulations for educational and professional use.

## Features

- **Vector Addition**: Sum two vectors with matching dimensions.
- **Vector Subtraction**: Subtract one vector from another of the same dimensions.
- **Scalar Multiplication and Division**: Easily scale vectors by multiplying or dividing with a scalar value.
- **Dot Product**: Compute the dot product between two compatible vectors.
- **Vector Transposition**: Switch between row and column vector representations.

## Installation

To get started with this library, clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DoDesCadeaux/vector.git
```

## Usage
Here's a quick example on how to use the library:

```python
from vector import Vector

# Create two vectors
v1 = Vector([[1], [2], [3]])
v2 = Vector([[4], [5], [6]])

# Add the vectors
v3 = v1 + v2
print(v3)
```
